    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <h2>This Is Me</h2>
    <img src="img/mypicture.jpg" alt="kimlan nguyen">
    <p>My name is Kimlan Nguyen</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>The year was 1991. I cried out loud for the first times in a hospital in Saigon, Vietnam.
      I had been living there for 18 years, and one day in 2009 I had a chance to go to America to study.
      Now I'm here at <span>Epicodus</span> coding day and night.</p>
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I graduated from Portland State University in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering.
      But I soon found out that civil engineering is not for me. After a lot of thought and consideration,
      I decided to take my interest in programming to the next level. I joined Epicodus.</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I am an outgoing person. I love dogs, science and video games. I enjoy making food and going out.</p>




    <h2>My Projects at Epicodus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kimlan1510/myFirstWebpage"><strong>My first webpage</strong></a><p>This is my first experience with <em>HTML</em>. This project includes basic <em>HTML</em> elements.</p></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kimlan1510/band"><strong>My favorite band</strong></a><p>I used <em>CSS</em> together with <em>HTML</em> to create a fake website for Reo Speedwagon that includes background info, tour dates. </p></li>
